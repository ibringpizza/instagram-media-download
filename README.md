# instagram-media-download
Two Tampermonkey scripts that let you download images and videos from Instagram in your browser (one for your feed and the other for profiles/tags)


Needs fixing:

Feed script needs to be updated to use the newest class names

This script sets creates download buttons on the head of a post. If you're using the feed script, irregular scrolling (up and down) usually causes a problem with the buttons and the downloaded media does not match the targetted media. This doesn't happen with the profile/tags script as the buttons are generated when you click to view a post.
